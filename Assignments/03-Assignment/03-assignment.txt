Episode 03 - Laying the Foundation.

Assignment
● What is JSX?
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It lets us write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
  Browsers don’t understand JSX directly, so a transpiler like Babel converts it into regular JavaScript that the browser can run.

● Superpowers of JSX

- We can use {} tp write JavaScript inside JSX.
- It Prevents XSS (cross-site-scripting). JSX escapes any malicious code, so it won't run harmful scripts. making it secure by deafult.
- JSX sanitizes and escapes dynamic values before ading them to the dom.
- JSX makes your UI code easier by combining and HTML structure and JS logic in one place.
- JSX works great with React component

● Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
type in <script> tells the browser what kind of script it is.

text/javascript → Default JS

module → For modern JS with import/export

importmap → To map custom module paths

Other types like application/json → Just for storing data, not running code.



● {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX


| Syntax                                | Meaning                                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `{TitleComponent}`                    | Refers to the component (not rendered) |
| `{<TitleComponent />}`                | Renders the component                  |
| `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` | Same as above (with/for children)      |
