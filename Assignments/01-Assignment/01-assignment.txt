What is Async and defer.

Async
- loads te scripts asynchronously and runs ig as soon as it's ready, without waiting for the HTML to finish parsing 
-HTML Parsing pauses when script is found, script loads in parallel, then executes immediately, then parsing resumes.

when to use: for independent scripts that don't rely on others and don't affect page structure.



defer

-Loads the script asynchronously but waits to run it until after the HTML is fully parsed.
-HTML parses fully, script loads in parallel, then all defered scripts execute after parsing.

when to use: for scripts that need the full HTML to be parsed before running, like most app scripts.
