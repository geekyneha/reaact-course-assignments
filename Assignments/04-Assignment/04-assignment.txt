* Chapter 04 - Talk is cheap, show me the code.

Assignment.

1. Is JSX mandatory for React.
   JSX is not a requirement for using React. Using React for calling React.createElement(componet, props, ...children). anything you can do with JSX can also be done with JavaScript.

2. Is ES6 mandatory for React.
   No it's not . but it's highly recommended. React code commonly uses ES^ features like arrow function, let and const. import/export, classes, destructuring, spread/rest operator. Withou ES6 you can still write react but it will be hard to manage.


3. How can I write comments in JSX.
   {/* This is a JSX commment*/}

4. What is <React.Fragement> </React.Fragement> and <></>?
  It lets us group multiple elements without adding extra  nodes to the DOM.
  - Avoids extra <div></div> wrappers.
  - Keep DOM clean.


5. What is Virtual DOM?
   The Virtuale DOM is an ideal or virtual representation of a UI .
   - React uses a Virtual DOM to track changes.
   - It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one.
   - Then, it updates only the changes parts in the real DOM.

6. What is Reconciliation in Raact?
   Reconciliation is the process react uses to update the DOM when your UI changes.
   -React uses a Virtual DOM to track changes.
   - It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one.
   - Then, it updates only the changes parts in the real DOM.

   This process is also called diffing.
   

7. What is React Fiber?
   React Fiber is the new reconciliation engine in React 16. Its main goal is to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM.


8. Why we need keys in React when do we need keys in React.
   Keys help React Identify which items changed, added removed in a list.
   They make the update process faster and more accurate.

   without keys.
   - may re-render wrongly.
   - can break component state or performance.


9. Can we use index as keys in React?
   Yes. We can use keys as index but it's not recommended unless yu have no better unique Identifier. use index only if list is static. The items won't change the order.
  

10. What is props in React? Ways to add props.
    Props stands for properties. It's an object. Props allows you to pass data from one component to another as an argument.
    when you want to pass data dynamically to the component we can pass it as props. Passing a props to a component is just like passing an argument to function.

11. What is a Config driven UI?
    Config driven UI means UI is driven by data(config).
    (API) We can control our UI according to the data from backend.s
