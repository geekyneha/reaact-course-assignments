1. Monolithic Architcture.


2. Microservice Architcture


3. When to make an API call

  2 ways 
  - page load -> Make API call and wait for Data -> render the UI.

  - page loads -> render the UI(shimmer UI) -> make API call -> Re render (Better Approach and UI experience)

4. useEffect Hook:
   -  It takes two arguments: a function and an array of dependencies.
   The function is executed after the component renders, and the dependencies array determines when the effect should be re-run.
  If the dependencies array is empty, the effect runs only once after the initial render.  

5. Fetch Promise.

  
6. CORS Policy: our browsers block us to call API from one origin to different origin.

 How can we bypass this CORS.CORS chrome extension.
